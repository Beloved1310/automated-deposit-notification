## Automated-deposit-notification


## Description
This project implements a backend system using Node.js and Express to manage notifications for users when automated deposits fail due to insufficient funds in their wallet. It leverages microservices for authentication, user management, and user wallet operations to ensure secure and efficient functionality.

## Features
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Utilizes middleware (`authMiddleware.js`) to secure endpoints.
- **User Management Service**: Retrieves user data (`user-service`).
- **User Wallet Service**: Manages wallet operations (`wallet-service`).
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications via email(`deposit-notification`).

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/Beloved1310/automated-deposit-notification>
   

## Future Improvements
Implement automated tests for robustness and reliability.
Implement a payment gateway 
Enhance error handling and logging capabilities.
Implement a cron job to automate failed transactions 
Extend functionality to support additional notification types or channels.

Assumptions
Microservices (Authentication, User Management, User Wallet) are independently running and accessible.
Email-sending utilities require appropriate implementations.
Basic error handling should be expanded for production readiness.
